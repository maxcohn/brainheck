Expansion of the beautiful language, brainf*ck

## What's different?

brainheck acts as a superset of brainf*ck with the goal of adding more useful commands for creating amazing programs.

### Current new commands

* **;** = Reads number into current cell
* **:** = Prints value of current cell as a number
* **#...#** = Comments
    * '#' denotes both the start and end of a comment
    * This is to make adding new features less dangerous to the use of existing programs

## But why?

When I was first looking into brainf*ck, I was amazed, and this led me down the rabbit hole that is esoteric programming languages.

I figured a great way to get my feet wet in this world would be making a super set of brainf*ck.
